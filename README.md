# moon-observations

We are attempting to use the [EDA](https://www.mwatelescope.org/telescope/external/eda) to detect EME signals on 2m.

Given the location of the antenna and the minimum elevation it can hear, we can calculate
when the moon is visible. If the moon is more than 20 degrees away from the galactic centre
at that time, we can use this observation window.
